= Giraffe

Generate graphs of the partials your Rails app uses    

== Install

    $ gem install giraffe

== Dependencies

* ruby-graphviz
* graphviz

== Usage
    
    g = Giraffe.new("/path/to/app/views")
    g.generate("graph.png")
    
Or, more succinctly:
    
    Giraffe.generate("/path/to/app/views", "graph.png")

== giraffe commandline

    $ giraffe /path/to/app/views/ graph.png
    
== Todo

It's pretty naive at the moment, doesn't deal with anything other than partials included by name etc...

Could do with being a bit more intelligent.
